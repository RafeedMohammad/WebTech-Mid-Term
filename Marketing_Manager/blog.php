		<h3>Blogging for Business?</h3>

		<h4>What is Business Blogging?</h5>
		<p>Business blogging is as essential to marketing a business as the yellowpages. A business blog is a marketing channel that helps businesses increase visibility online, brand awareness, blog subscribers, and support business growth.</p>
		

		<h4>The Truth About Business Blogging</h5>
		<p>With so much contradictory information (and opinion) being thrown around, it can be difficult to know what to really expect from blogging for business.Business blogging has evolved quickly and much of the information you find online is simply outdated, even if it was technically true a few years ago.In 2011, for example, before blogging was fully-accepted as a legitimate marketing tactic for businesses, Daily Blog Tips shared 6 ugly truths about blogging. At the time, they were all valid points to consider, but as expected with time, many have grown untrue. These six statements represent common beliefs (and misconceptions) that still exist today. For those of you new to the medium, let's take a few minutes to set the record straight about each one. </p>
